	<h1> Teaching, Outreach, and Leadership </h1>
	<p> I've been teaching in one way or another my whole life, whether that's been as an official lecturer or TA for science and engineering classes, a private music teacher, or the person everyone in college went to for homework help. I couldn't possibly list all of my experience, but here are a few teaching moments that have meant the most to me.</p>

		<h2> MSI Science Communication Fellow </h2>
		<p> Following a two-year series of communication workshops designed to enhance discussion of science topics with the youth and public, I developed a presentation and hands-on activity that taught students the importance of solar energy and what can be done to improve current solar cell devices. <p>

		<h2> Volunteer Physics Lecturer at UC Lab School </h2>
		<p>Through the University of Chicago Society of Women in Physics, I volunteered to teach two physics classes to 8th grade students at the University of Chicago Laboratory School. In each class, I gave a lecture on electromagnetism and led a hands-on activity teaching the students how to build a speaker from household materials. <p>

		<h2> Science Outreach Volunteer </h2>
		<p>I've volunteered at numerous outreach events, museums, and conventions throughout my graduate and undergraduate career. As an example, at the ECCC Kids area of Emerald City Comicon in 2013, I worked with fellow NASA scientists and engineers in an interactive outreach event to teach about the Curiosity Rover on Mars.<p>
