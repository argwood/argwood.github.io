If you're anything like me, the summer of 2016 meant the summer of Pokemon GO, where everywhere you turned it seemed like there wasn't anyone *not* playing this nostalgic augmented reality game of catching fake little monsters from your phone. You played too, because, well, everyone was doing it and the Pokemon World was kind of better than the real one. However, unlike me, you probably stopped playing a few months later once the initial hype wore off. For the past 2 years (starting around the
beginning of 2017), I've been one of the lead moderators for the [Chicago Pokemon GO Discord server](https://discord.gg/sSeeGPs) and helped it grow from a handful of players up to 9,000 members today. This "job" has included all kinds of work including event planning, writing, [creating a website with merch](https://dtc.fyi), and countless hours moderating chat and helping newcomers. The biggest and best part of this job, though, has been developing bots to help moderate, answer repetitive questions so
that we don't have to tell people the same thing over and over again, and provide information to users including Pokemon typing and stats, comparisons between 'mons of different stats, a leaderboard for the competitive folks, and links to the server/website/etc.

*"What's a Discord bot?"* you may ask. Well, think of [Discord](https://discordapp.com) as the modern Ventrilo-meets-Skype-meets-Slack-for-gamers where you have a server that acts as a home for your gaming community, complete with text chat and voice chat and *lovely new organization options like channel categories and server folders*. Discord has a great open-source API, which means developers can create bots for their communities that can do essentially whatever the developer can dream
up: play games against an AI, make polls, make sure users aren't breaking your rules, spit out random quotes from your favorite TV shows... 

Here's Botty - he's been used by thousands of Pokemon GO players in Chicago since 2017 (and is being used in servers in 3 other states as well), and has come to be as his own robot-personality over the past two years. You can find his code on [my github](github.com/argwood/Botty-2.0). You'll find a few other bots on there as well, including a Sorting Hat bot I made when Wizards Unite was released, a sort of throwback to my childhood that was mostly spent pretending to be at Hogwarts.
